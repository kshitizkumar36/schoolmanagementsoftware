      <p style="text-align: justify;">Quality education provides a strong foundation to life of a human being, and it is truly
said that Education is life. We all know that our society is facing many insurmountable
problems today, like-alarming high growth rate of population, socio-economic and
ethnological tensions, negligible mobility in poor segment of society, increasing disparities
with diffusion of new technology. In such conditions, it is impossible to achieve the goal of
growth with social justice; undoubtedly an egalitarian education can help to minimize the
problem to ensure that all children of nation get proper education. Hence, Gurudev Ravindra
Nath Tagore points out that The widest road to remove all existing problems is education.
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Balumath is a large community development block of Latehar district of Jharkhand, but
as per 2011 Census, only 58.22 percent of total population is literate .The condition of female
literacy is more pitiable as it is only 38.69 percent of total population. As a parent, we want
best for our children, many family moves to cities to provide best environment of education
for their children but because of many existing circumstances like lack of money etc., a large
part of society is not able to enjoy the educational facilities as that of cities. Keeping in mind
the socio-economic conditions and need of quality education of this region we are working to
provide affordable and quality education at grass-root level, so that the people of all segments
can get the benefits of modern education for a better future.

unsustainable in our country at the time. We need entrepreneurial brains to maneuver with
the pace of world and subsume the pressure of job demands. For all these, skills are required
with good education. The preliminary understanding of this fact must be inculcated in
students since their childhood.
B S Memorial High School Balumath is creating a congenial environment to instill the
basic skills like communicative skills, writing skills, learning of computer and internet, games
and sports, painting and so on. So that at any time in their lives, students can confidently
decide for entrepreneurship and further excel. These will be helpful in passing through the
difficult phases in their lives.
Along with quality education and basic skills, the other important factor in one’s life is
moral values. In schools, we learn human values like friendship, cooperation, togetherness,
justice, respect and so on. B S Memorial High school Balumath keeps all these in the reckoning
and tries to shape students’ behavior with the inculcation of values in this highly aggressive
and materialistic world.

      Children have always been our future. When we see exiting problems around us like – poverty, unemployment, hunger, homelessness, social-unrests, violence, women-exploitation, communalism, discrimination, terrorism, environmental degradation and many other tensions, solution stops at only point, that is – EDUCATION. 
Education is not preparation for life, education is life itself, and the aim of education is to prepare the children to learn throughout their lives. The goal of preparing child for themselves and society as a whole can be achieved only through the spirit of togetherness among school, students, home, and society all four of these. 

At B S Memorial High School Balumath, we create suitable environment for the all-round development of students on the basis of human values, so that they can make their best contributions to our society. In order to fulfill the demands of modern education, we provide a beautiful, peaceful and healthy campus, all basic amenities, effective teaching and learning process through highly skilled teachers and modern educational tools and techniques.
